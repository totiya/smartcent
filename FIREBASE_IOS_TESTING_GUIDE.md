# üçé Firebase iOS Testing Setup Guide

## üö® **Important: Building iOS Apps on Windows**

**Flutter on Windows cannot build iOS apps.** You need a Mac to build iOS apps. Here are your options:

### **Option 1: Access to Mac (Recommended)**
- Your own Mac
- Friend's or colleague's Mac
- Mac rental service (MacStadium, MacInCloud)
- CI/CD service (GitHub Actions, Codemagic)

### **Option 2: Use Codemagic CI/CD (Build iOS in Cloud)**
Codemagic can build your iOS app in the cloud without needing a Mac.

## üî• **Step 1: Complete Firebase Setup**

### **1.1 Create Firebase Project**
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Click **"Create a project"**

#### **2. Configure codemagic.yaml**
Create this file in your project root:

```yaml
workflows:
  ios-workflow:
    name: iOS Workflow
    max_build_duration: 60
    environment:
      flutter: stable
      xcode: latest
      cocoapods: default
    scripts:
