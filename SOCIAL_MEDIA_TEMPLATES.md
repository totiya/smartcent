Hi [Name],

Exciting news! SmartCent just got even smarter.

🆕 INTRODUCING: Duplicate Detection

Ever accidentally scanned the same receipt twice? We've all been there. Now SmartCent automatically catches potential duplicates and alerts you before they mess up your budget.

How it works:
🔍 Scans for matching amounts, dates, and merchants
🚨 Shows you a friendly warning if it spots a duplicate
✅ Lets you choose to add it anyway (in case it's legitimate)

This feature is already live in your app - no update needed!

Try it out:
1. Scan a receipt
2. Scan the same receipt again
3. Watch SmartCent protect your budget
